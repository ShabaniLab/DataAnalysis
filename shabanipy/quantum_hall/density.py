def extract_density(field, rxy, field_cutoffs):
    """Extract the carriers density from the low field resistance dependence.

    The extraction relies on a simple linear fit performed on a specified field
    range.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : np.ndarray
        Magnetic field values for which the the transverse resistance was
        measured.
        This can be a multidimensional array in which case the last
        dimension will be considered as the swept dimension.
    rxy : np.ndarray
        Transverse resistance values which were measured.
        This can be a multidimensional array in which case the last dimension
        will be considered as the swept dimension.
    field_cutoffs : tuple | np.ndarray
        Pairs of low/high field values on which to perform the linear fit. If
        only one pair of value is provided it will be used for all fits.

    Returns
    -------
    densities : float | np.ndarray
        Densities extracted from the linear fit. Will be a float if a single
        value was extracted from the provided data.

    densities_stderr : float | np.ndarray
        Incertitude on the density expressed as the standard deviation.
        Will be a float if a single value was extracted from the provided data.

    fits : lmfit.model.ModelResult | np.ndarray
        Object containing the result of the fit.
